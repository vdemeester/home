Time for the first new monthly status update! I do like those updates from [[https://drewdevault.com/2020/06/15/Status-update.html][Drew DeVault]]
and [[https://emersion.fr/blog/2020/status-update-19/][Simon Ser]], so I figured, why not trying myself 🙃. I am not sure where to start and
where to end, but I guess I'll figure things out as I go.

A really small article to talk about small updates on the website (/well, maybe not that
small/). In a gist: a new css and articles changes.

- Updating the style of the website to something really similar to [[https://newcss.net/][new.css]]. It is way
  simpler and /pleasing/ (at least for me).
- My [[../articles][=/articles=]] are now exporting from my [[../articles/personal_knowledge_base.org][personal knowledge base]], powered by
  [[../articles/org_roam.org][=org-roam=]].
- A new [[https://dl.sbr.pm/][=/files=]] part is available, where I share some random file. See for example the
  [[https://dl.sbr.pm/wallpapers/dynamics/][dynamic wallpaper]] part.

Since go 1.14 go released, I've had a broken =go-mode= setup on my Emacs. I was using
=lsp-mode= and =gopls= and well, the update broke everything. I initally try to fix it but
I made it worse. At the same time, I started to get fed up with some performance issue of
my configuration and how slow my Emacs starts, about 6s.

I, thus, declared my third Emacs bankruptcy, =:disabled= everything and slowly started
from scratch, with the following goal:

- Have it start quick, as less than a second, not too much more than =emacs -Q= would
- Disable anything that I don't use often initially
- Try to use as much built-in as possible (example: using =icomplete= instead of
  =ivy=/=counsel=)

This is a story… a story of me changing the way I code and publish my website. In the
past, I've switch from [[https://vincent.demeester.fr/posts/2012-05-07-reinit-and-jekyll/][Jekyll]] to [[https://vincent.demeester.fr/posts/2015-05-01-orgmode-et-jekyll/]["=orgmode= and Jekyll"]] to [[https://vincent.demeester.fr/posts/2015-05-09-migration-to-hugo/][Hugo]] (sorry those are written
in french). The past year, I've written and documented myself a little bit about
[[https://www.theminimalists.com/minimalism/][minimalism]] and [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40672036-digital-minimalism][digital minimalism]]. Although I don't see myself as a minimalist, it helped
me realize some issues I had.

I also realized if I want to write more, I need to lower the barrier between writing and
publishing my content ; /if I want it to be published, of course/. This /post/ is about
what I'm putting in place for this, with a premise : I spend my life in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] and thus in
[[https://orgmode.org/][=orgmode=]]. And [[https://orgmode.org/][=orgmode=]] is feature-full and has this badass feature : =org-publish=.

To build and publish this website, we will /try/ to rely on a reproducible setup, meaning
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] and [[https://orgmode.org/][=orgmode=]] of course, [[https://www.gnu.org/software/make/][GNU Make]] of course *but* most importantly, [[https://nixos.org/nix/][Nix]] (in the near
future 👼).

There is now an article about it, that uses literate programming: [[../articles/meta_publishing_this_website.org][publishing this

I've been reading and listening about Minimalism and Digital Minimalism for a little while
now. I've watch some [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ24N4O0bP7LGLBDvye7oCA][Matt D'Avella]] youtube video (and documentary), read [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40672036-digital-minimalism][Digital
Minimalism]] from [[https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/147891.Cal_Newport][Cal Newport]], and read a bunch of [[Links][articles and blog posts]].

I wouldn't say I am a minimalist, neither am I a digital minimalist *but* it is something
that is a bit appealing and I feel I am slowly taking inspiration from those. I've started
reducing to a minimun what my /smart/-phone does, I've reduced the number of /gadgets/
I've add over time. But in this posts, I am going to focus on my systems and tools — this
means Linux distributions, Emacs and other tools.

Let's continue the [[https://gotest.tools][=gotest.tools=]] serie, this time with the =poll= package.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Package poll provides tools for testing asynchronous code.
#+END_QUOTE

When you write test, you may test a piece of code that work asynchronously, where the
state you're expecting is gonna take a bit of time to be achieved. This is especially true
when you work on networking or file-system code. And this happens a lot when you write
integration (or end-to-end) test, less for unit-tests.

The package =poll= is trying to tackle those use cases. We'll first take a look at the
main function, =WaitOn=, then how to write a ~Check~, using the ~Result~ type.

I use [[https://nixos.org/][=NixOS=]] each and every day, everywhere. One really cool feature of =nix= is
=nix-shell= and more recently (with =nix= >= =2.0.0=), =nix run=.

#+begin_src man
Usage: nix run <FLAGS>... <INSTALLABLES>...

Summary: run a shell in which the specified packages are available.

Flags:
      --arg <NAME> <EXPR>         argument to be passed to Nix functions
      --argstr <NAME> <STRING>    string-valued argument to be passed to Nix functions
  -c, --command <COMMAND> <ARGS>  command and arguments to be executed; defaults to 'bash'
  -f, --file <FILE>               evaluate FILE rather than the default
  -i, --ignore-environment        clear the entire environment (except those specified with --keep)
  -I, --include <PATH>            add a path to the list of locations used to look up <...> file names
  -k, --keep <NAME>               keep specified environment variable
  -u, --unset <NAME>              unset specified environment variable

Examples:

  To start a shell providing GNU Hello from NixOS 17.03:
  $ nix run -f channel:nixos-17.03 hello

  To start a shell providing youtube-dl from your 'nixpkgs' channel:
  $ nix run nixpkgs.youtube-dl

  To run GNU Hello:
  $ nix run nixpkgs.hello -c hello --greeting 'Hi everybody!'

  To run GNU Hello in a chroot store:
  $ nix run --store ~/my-nix nixpkgs.hello -c hello

Note: this program is EXPERIMENTAL and subject to change.
#+end_src

As you can see from the =-h= summary, it makes it really easy to run a shell or a command
with some packages that are not in your main configuration. It will download the
package(s) if there are not available in the Nix store (=/nix/store/=).

A few month ago I decided it would be a perfect use-case for command I do not run
often. My idea was, let's define =aliases= (in the shell) that would make a simple command
call, like =ncdu=, become =nix run nixpkgs.ncdu -c ndcu=. My /shell of choice/ is [[https://fishshell.com/][fish]], so
I decided to dig into the /language/ in order to implement that.

The use case is the following :
- When I type =foo=, I want the command =foo= in package =bar= to be executed.
- I want to be able to pin a channel for the package — I'm using [[https://matthewbauer.us/][Matthew Bauer]] [[https://matthewbauer.us/blog/channel-changing.html][Channel
  Changing with Nix]] setup for pin-pointing a given channel.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Package fs provides tools for creating temporary files, and testing the contents and structure of a directory.
#+END_QUOTE

This package is heavily using functional arguments (as we saw in [[/posts/2017-01-01-go-testing-functionnal-builders/][functional arguments for
wonderful builders]]). Functional arguments is, in a nutshell, a combinaison of two Go
features : /variadic/ functions (=...= operation in a function signature) and the fact
that =func= are /first class citizen/. This looks more or less like that.

#+BEGIN_SRC go
  type Config struct {}

  func MyFn(ops ...func(*Config)) *Config {
          c := &Config{} // with default values
          for _, op := range ops {
                  op(c)
          }
          return c
  }

  // Calling it
  conf := MyFn(withFoo, withBar("baz"))
#+END_SRC

The =fs= package has too *main* purpose :

1. create folders and files required for testing in a simple manner
2. compare two folders structure (and content)

Let's continue the [[https://gotest.tools][=gotest.tools=]] serie, this time with the =golden= package. This is a
[[/posts/2017-04-22-golang-testing-golden-file/][/quick follow-up/ on a previous =golden= post]], but focused on the =gotest.tools=
implementation. I'm gonna be quicker, please read that one if =golden= files is a new
concept for you.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Package =golden= provides tools for comparing large mutli-line strings.

Golden files are files in the =./testdata/= sub-directory of the package under test.
#+END_QUOTE

In the previous article, we described the problem, and how to fix it by writing a small
helper. Well, that small helper is in =gotest.tools/golden= now, and it has a tiny bit
more features.

One of the difference between the =gotest.tools= implementation and the previous post is
the flag name. In =gotest.tools/golden=, the flag is =-test.update-golden= (was just
=-test.update= before). Just as before, if the =-test.update-golden= flag is set then the
actual content is written to the golden file, before reading it and comparing.

There is two ways to use the =golden= package:
- on it's own, using =golden.Assert= or =golden.AssertBytes=
- as a =cmp.Comparison=, with =golden.String= or =golden.Bytes=

:END:


Let's continue the [[https://gotest.tools][=gotest.tools=]] serie, this time with the =skip= package. This is a
really simple one so this should be quick.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
=skip= provides functions for skipping a test and printing the source code of the
condition used to skip the test.
#+END_QUOTE

The package consists of only one function : =If=. The idea comes mainly from
[[https://github.com/docker/docker][=docker/docker=]] integration test suite, where we wanted to skip some test (or test suites)
given different context. By context I mean things like the system we are running on
(=Windows=, =Linux=, …) or the capabilities of the running kernel or node (is =apparmor=
available or not on the current machine).

This =If= method takes a =testing.T= pointer and either a boolean, a function that
returns a boolean, *or* an expression.

#+BEGIN_SRC go
  // boolean
  //   --- SKIP: TestName (0.00s)
  //           skip.go:19: MissingFeature
  var MissingFeature bool
  skip.If(t, MissingFeature)

  // function
  //   --- SKIP: TestName (0.00s)
  //           skip.go:19: !IsExperimentalDaemon(dockerClient): daemon is not experimental
  skip.If(t, IsExperimentalDaemon(dockerClient), "daemon is not experimental")

  // expression
  //   --- SKIP: TestName (0.00s)
  //           skip.go:19: apiVersion < version("v1.24")
  skip.If(t, apiVersion < version("v1.24"))
#+END_SRC

There is few elements to note though :

- This package (as other parts of the =gotest.tools= packages), will try to look at source
  files to display the expression used (same goes for =assert=). This is usually not a
  problem because you run tests where the source code is. *However*, in the cases you
  generate a test binary to be executed later (à-la =kubernetes= or other projects), this
  can display a weird error message if the sources are not available… You shouldn't be
  worried too much about it, but it's better if you know :)
- The main reason to use =skip.If= is mainly for new contributors to get in quickly,
  *reducing potential friction of them running the tests on their environment*. The more
  the tests are written in a way they explicitely declare their requirements (and skipped
  if the environment does not meet those), the easier it makes contributors run your
  tests. *But*, this also means, you should try to measure the skipped tests on your
  continuous integration system to make sure you run all of them eventually… otherwise
  it's dead code. /But more on that in later posts 😉/.

That's all for today folks, told you that was going to be quick.

Let's take a closer look at [[https://gotest.tools][=gotest.tools=]] assertions packages. This is mainly about =assert=, =assert/cmp= and
=assert/opt=.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Package assert provides assertions for comparing expected values to actual values. When assertion fails a helpful error
message is printed.
#+END_QUOTE

There is two main functions (=Assert= and =Check=) and some helpers (like =NilError=, …). They all take a =*testing.T= as
a first argument, pretty common across testing Go libraries. Let's dive into those !

I already wrote 2 previous posts about golang and testing. It's something I care deeply
about and I wanted to continue writing about it. It took me a bit more time than I
thought, but getting back to it. Since the [[http://vincent.demeester.fr/posts/2017-04-22-golang-testing-golden-file/][last post]], Daniel Nephin and I worked (but
mainly Daniel 🤗) on bootstrapping a testing helper library.

Let me introduce it to you this library : [[https://gotest.tools][=gotest.tools=]]. As described in the [[https://godoc.org/gotest.tools][godoc]] package comment, =gotest.tools= is a
collection of packages to augment =testing= and support common patterns. It's an enhanced and growing version of the
initial helpers we (the docker/moby maintainers) wrote initially in [[https://github.com/docker/docker][=docker/docker=]] repository. We are using in quite some
project here at [[https://github.com][Docker]].

There is a bunch of packages that will all have their own post (linked here when available) :

- [[file:2018-08-16-gotest-tools-assertions.org][=assert=]] (with =assert/cmp= and =assert/opt=) that provides assertions for comparing expected values to actual values.
- =env= that provides functions to test code that read environment variable or the current working directory.
- [[file:2018-09-14-gotest-tools-fs.org][=fs=]] that provides tools for creating temporary files, and testing the contents and structure of a directory.
- [[file:2018-09-06-gotest-tools-golden.org][=golden=]] that provides tools for comparing large multi-line strings.
- [[file:2018-09-18-gotest-tools-icmd.org][=icmd=]] that executes binaries and provides convenient assertions for testing the results.
- [[file:2019-03-23-gotest-tools-poll.org][=poll=]] that provides tools for testing asynchronous code.
- [[file:2018-09-01-gotest-tools-skip.org][=skip=]] that provides functions for skipping a test and printing the source code of the condition used to skip the test.

There is also experimental package, using the =x= notation (as the golang team uses, for example with =golang.org/x/sync=) :

- =x/subtest= that provides a =TestContext= to subtests which handles cleanup and provides a =testing.TB= and =context.Context=.

There is already some good =testing= helpers in the Go ecosystem : [[https://github.com/stretchr/testify][=testify=]], [[http://labix.org/gocheck][=gocheck=]], [[https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo][=ginkgo=]] and a lot more — so
why create a new one ? There is multiple reason for it, most of them can be seen in the following [[https://github.com/gotestyourself/gotest.tools/issues/49#issuecomment-362436026][GitHub issue]].

[[https://github.com/dnephin/][Daniel]] also wrote a very useful converter if your code base is currently using =testify= : =gty-migrate-from-testify=.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ go get -u gotest.tools/assert/cmd/gty-migrate-from-testify
# […]
$ go list \
     -f '{{.ImportPath}} {{if .XTestGoFiles}}{{"\n"}}{{.ImportPath}}_test{{end}}' \
     ./... | xargs gty-migrate-from-testify
#+END_SRC

In the next post, let's dig into the assertion part of the library, package =assert= 👼.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Voici un petit billet présentant les différents podcast que j'écoute
  plus ou moins régulièrement.
#+END_QUOTE

J'écoute énormément de musique et de podcast ; je passe beaucoup de
temps avec des écouteurs sur la tête ou la chaine hifi en route. Les
podcasts ont une grande place. Voici une liste plus ou moins bien triés
de ceux auxquels je suis souscrit et/ou que j'écoute en ce moment. Je
tiendrais peut-être ce post à jour ou en créerait un nouveau sinon :-).

Je suis un utilisateur convaincu de [[http://maven.apache.org/][maven]], malgré ces défauts, le
moto *"Convention over configuration"* me va vraiment bien. Que ce soit
au boulot ou à la maison, j'ai plus d'ordinateurs équipés de ssd (ou de
mémoire flash) que de disque traditionnel (mécanique ?). Pour augmenter
un peu la durée de vie de ces disques SSD, j'ai cherché à savoir comment
/déporter/ le /build/ de maven (qui, pour rappel, se passe dans le
dossier =target/=) hors du SSD ; ici ce sera dans le dossier =/tmp/= qui
est monté en mémoire (merci =tmpfs=), mais on peut imaginer déporter ça
sur un autre disque, etc.. Après quelques recherches j'ai trouvés
quelques inspirations.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Limitations*

  Dans la solution présentée ci-dessous les principales limitations sont
  les suivantes (que j'essaierais de diminuer au fil du temp ;P) :

  1. Il est nécessaire de modifier le pom.xml du projet ; cela ne
     s'appliquera donc pas à tous les projets maven sans modification du
     pom.xml.
  2. Cela ne fonctionne que sur une plateforme qui support les liens
     symboliques (Linux, Mac OS X, et autre UNIX).
  3. Cela ne fonctionne qu'avec Java 7 ou plus.
  4. Si vous utilisez m2e, il va gentillement gueuler et c'est moche ; pour résoudre le
     problème, il faut faire un tour vers [[http://wiki.eclipse.org/M2E_plugin_execution_not_covered][M2E plugin execution not covered]].
#+END_QUOTE

Pour [[http://maven.apache.org/][maven]], le dossier =target/= vient de la propriété
=project.build.directory=. Dans la théorie, il suffirait de modifier
(dans =$HOME/.m2/settings.xml=) cette propriété et le tour serait jouer.
Malheuresement ce n'est pas possible, =project.build.directory= est une
propriété interne et n'est, à priori, pas modifiable.

Notre souhait est le suivant :

1. Le build doit se faire dans =/tmp/m2/=, ce qui pour un projet se
   traduit par =/tmp/m2/${groupId}:${artifactId}=.
2. Le dossier =target/= dans les sources est un lien symbolique vers le
   dossier dans =/tmp/m2/=
3. On passe par un *profile* qui n'est *pas actif* par défaut (pour ne
   pas faire chier le monde) mais *activable via une propriété* (maven
   nous permet de le faire et c'est cool =^_^=). La propriété utilisée
   sera =external.build.root=.

Le code ci-dessous est repris directement de mon inspiration[fn:1]. Il
s'occupe de créer le dossier =${groupId}:${artifactId}= dans
=external.build.root= et de faire le lien dans le dossier courant.

Ainsi, il suffit ensuite d'avoir quelques choses du genre dans son
=$HOME/.m2/settings.xml= pour que les builds qui ont ce profil se
/build/ dans =/tmp/m2/=. On peut aussi ne rien avoir dans
=$HOME/.m2/settings.xml= et utilise =-Dexternal.build.root=/tmp/m2/=
avec la commande =mvn=.

<settings>
    <!-- […] -->
    <profiles>
        <profile>
            <id>build-in-ramfs</id>
            <properties>
                <external.build.root>/tmp/m2/</external.build.root>
            </properties>
        </profile>
    </profiles>
    <activeProfiles>
        <activeProfile>build-in-ramfs</activeProfile>

Il y a environ 4 mois j'ai eu un accident de vélo ; un traumatisme
crânien, des brulures sur la face, quelques points de sutures, un doigt
cassé et une hernie discale m'ont cloué (et me clou encore) plus que
d'habitude sur ma chaise de bureau. Le bon côté des choses, c'est que
cela m'a permit de me poser et de réfléchir une bonne façon d'être
efficace et organiser, au travail et à la maison :-).

Une des principales /action/ que j'ai pris est d'utiliser un wiki local
et synchronisé sur /tout/ mes PCs. Le /format/ wiki est assez adapté à
une prise de note et à la création de contenu plus complet (comme des
[[http://shortbrain.org][articles]] ou de la documentation pour des
projets en cours). Les conditions étaient les suivantes :

- Facilité de mise en place.
- Pas de base de données.
- /Merging/ facile ([[http://git-scm.com][git]] /rules my world/).
- [[http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/][Markdown]] comme
  syntaxe, car utilisé à peu près partout (blogs, articles, READMEs,
  documentations).
- Éditable à partir d'une interface web ou de mon éditeur favoris.

L'outil qui remplit presque toutes ces conditions s'appelle
[[https://github.com/github/gollum][gollum]]. C'est un moteur wiki,
écris en ruby, qui se base sur un repository
[[http://git-scm.com][git]]. Il est développer par l'équipe de
[[http://github.com][Github]] et c'est celui qui est utilisé par les
pages wiki là-bas. Il permet d'utiliser à peu près n'importe quel
syntaxe (dont
[[https://github.com/github/github-flavored-markdown][github-markdown]]
qui est assez proche de celle de
[[http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc][pandoc]]). Par ailleurs, comme il se
base sur [[http://git-scm.com][git]], les points /"pas de base de
données"/, /"merging facile"/ et /"éditable également à partir de mon
éditeur favoris"/ sont toutes remplies.

Avec [[https://github.com/github/gollum][Gollum]] vous avez un wiki
markdown décentralisé, éditable via une interface web ou via votre
éditeur favoris.

I like a lot the [[http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/][gitflow]] way of managing project. When working on maven project, there is
few great plugins that helps to get the work done. One of them is [[http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-release-plugin][maven-release-plugin]].

Inspired on this [[https://gist.github.com/1043970][gist]], I've come
with a cool way of doing things (let say we want to release a 0.1
version of an artifact) :

I'm running a gitolite _instance_ on my personal server to manage my repositories
(personnal, private or public) ; and I am quickly going to share with you how I setup a
_quick and dirty_ mirror feature.

First, I am using **gitolite 3**. The mirroring we are going to setup is not the
_supported_ [[http://sitaramc.github.com/gitolite/mirroring.html][mirroring *built-in*]].  We are going to implement a simplier way to set mirror
thing :

1. Write a custom gitolite command ; the idea is to be able to write ~git-config~ stuff.
2. Write a hook that take a specific ~git-config~ (let say ~mirror.url~) and do a simple
   mirroring.

Two weeks ago, my /online/ personal server has been attacked and,
somehow, died. I'm in the process of re-installation of it but I'm going
to hardened a bit the security on it. Anyway, this crash meant that
every piece of site I maintain has been down. That's why I moved this
/identity site/ on the github pages, using a CNAME ; That way I can
crash as much as I want my server(s), this page should still be up for a
while.

And I'm switching on Jekyll for this website as It is supported by
Github page, easy to use and easy to deploy elsewhere (if one day I want
to move from Github).

The rest of the post is going to be used as a /sandbox/ post to test the
site styles.
