** Building Firmware

From the =keyboards/= directory, use the Makefile:

#+begin_src bash
# Build Moonlander firmware
make moonlander/build

# Build Eyelash Corne firmware
make eyelash_corne/build
# or use the shorter alias
make corne/build
#+end_src

** Flashing Firmware

#+begin_src bash
# Flash Moonlander (wired)
make moonlander/flash

# Flash Eyelash Corne (wireless)
make eyelash_corne/flash
# or use the shorter alias
make corne/flash
#+end_src

** Other Targets

#+begin_src bash
# Build all keyboards
make all

# Update QMK (Moonlander only)
make moonlander/update

# Clean build artifacts
make clean
make moonlander/clean

# Show help
make help
#+end_src

** From Repository Root

All keyboard targets are also available from the repository root Makefile:

#+begin_src bash
cd /path/to/home
make moonlander/build
make eyelash_corne/flash
#+end_src

* Common Layouts

Both keyboards share similar layout philosophies:

** Primary Layout: Bépo

French-optimized layout based on [[https://bepo.fr][bépo]] with adaptations for split ergonomic keyboards.
- Works with US International layout on the host OS
- Home row mods for modifiers
- Layer-based access to symbols, numbers, and navigation

** Alternative Layouts

- *ErgoL*: Alternative French layout based on [[https://ergol.org][ErgoL]]
- *QWERTY*: Standard layout for compatibility

** Shared Features

- Home row mods (GUI, Alt, Shift, Ctrl, Hyper)
- Smart numword layer for efficient number entry
- Combos for frequently used keys
- French accent support via macros/Unicode
- Multiple layers: Base, Symbols, Numbers, Navigation, Function

* Configuration Philosophy

- Minimize finger movement with home row mods
- Layer-based approach for symbols and numbers
- French language support as first-class citizen
- Optimized for programming and text editing
- Wireless option (Corne) and wired option (Moonlander) for different use cases
