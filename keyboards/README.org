make moonlander/build    # or moonlander/flash

* Layout Features

Both keyboards use:
- *Primary*: [[https://bepo.fr][Bépo]] (French-optimized) | *Alternatives*: [[https://ergol.org][ErgoL]], QWERTY
- Home row mods (GUI, Alt, Shift, Ctrl, Hyper)

* Configuration Philosophy

- Optimized for programming and text editing
- Wireless option (Corne) and wired option (Moonlander) for different use cases
