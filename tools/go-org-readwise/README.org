#+TITLE: `go-org-readwise`

This is a very very simple project that sync from readwise API to a
set of org files in a folder. It implements just what is needed from
the [readwise API](https://readwise.io/api_deets) to work.

* Readwise API

We are /only/ going to implement the export part of the API as, this should be the only one
we need.

If you want to pull all of the highlights from a user's account into your service (eg
notetaking apps, backups, etc) this endpoint is all you need!

** TODO Explore =v3= API

In theory I could rely on the =v3= API to get documents that are "archived" but have no
highlights. Not sure this is something I want to do though.

I doesn't have highlight soâ€¦ I would have to query both.

See https://readwise.io/reader_api.
