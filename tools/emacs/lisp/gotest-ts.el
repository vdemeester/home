;;; Commentary:

;; This mode provides Emacs functionality for running tests using GoTest
;; and Treesitter.
;;
;; It supports running test functions and subtests in .go files with Treesitter
;; support.
;;
;; Bug:
;; When you have different structure inside a subtest that has a Name: it would
;; pick up the wrong one.You just need to place yourself in the right struct
;; where the name is.
;;
;;; Code:
