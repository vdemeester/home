Your wish has been granted. You can commit to Emacs and GNU ELPA. Feel free to
use this power, but please try to be extra careful and prove yourself worthy
of this privilege:

- Send your patches for review before installing them.

- Only install changes whose code follows the usual coding conventions. Some
  of those conventions are documented in http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards;
  you'll discover others during code review.

- Always provide a good commit message (copied into or from the ChangeLog for
  emacs.git), following the GNU coding standards (e.g. using the
  present/imperative tense, and syntax described at
  http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Change-Logs.html), and properly
  labelling the author of the code.

- If the change is a new feature or a change in behavior, don't forget to
  mention it in the etc/NEWS file and to update the Texinfo doc accordingly.

- Be sure your change is accepted as being for the better by the package's
  maintainer. As a general rule send your patch for review before installing
  it, unless you're absolutely positively 200% sure that everyone will be
  pleased with the content and the form of the patch.

Last but not least:

- And make extra sure that all the code you install has the proper copyright:
  if it is not your own code, make sure the author has signed the relevant
  copyright papers (for non-trivial contributions), and indicate the author
  correctly in the commit (and the ChangeLog if applicable).

If you have the slightest doubt about any of those points, send your question
or your patch to emacs-devel@gnu.org (or bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org).

Thank you very much for your contribution to Emacs,
