The list of sections still needing to be proofread is here:

  http://ftp.newartisans.com/pub/emacs-manual.html

If you'd like a suggestion, how about:

| Chapter | Part | Title                          | Page | Length |
|---------+------+--------------------------------+------+--------|
|      24 |   17 | Compiling and Testing Programs |  277 |     20 |

Otherwise, please pick any section(s) without a "Checked By" name, and e-mail
emacs-manual-bugs@gnu.org with the Ch/Pt numbers. I'll then add you to the
volunteered list. Once you have some edits, send them to the same list, and
I'll add you to the Checked By column for that section.

It's OK to proofread something that's already been done, if you were hoping to
brush up on that part of the manual. It's our goal to make sure everything is
seen at least three times.

Richard has sent instructions to many of you, but in case you haven't received
them yet, they can be found here:
